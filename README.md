# HandWashTimer
The hand washing timer is a project with Attiny85, neopixel, pir sensor and 3D parts to create a useful counter time to wash your hands in covid-19 period and more.

In the last week I made my version of hand washing timer with:

- n.1 Attiny85
- n.1 Dc-Dc step down to 5v
- n.1 Neopixel ring 16
- n.1 mini pir sensor
- n.4 battery type AA ( 1,5v )
- n.1 battery holder for 4 AA batteries
- n.1 micro switch
